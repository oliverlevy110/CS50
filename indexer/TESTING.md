# TESTING for indexer, Oliver Levy, CS50, TSE Project

## Plan

The program first tests indexer with valid parameters. The test is successful and writes the index to `indexertest1`.

Next, the program runs indexer with an invalid (non-existant) directory.

Lastly, the program runs indexer with an existing directory that is not created by `crawler.c`.
 
### Run
To run, cd into the `indexer` directory, then call:
`indexertest.sh`

#### Results
```
TESTING INDEXER.C
Test with valid parameters
Done 
Test with invalid (non-existant) directory

Test with invalid (non-crawler) directory

END OF TESTING
```
