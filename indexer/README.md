## Compilation
To compile, run `make` in the indexer directory. You can also compile indexer though the tse directory Makefile.

To clean, run `make clean`.

### Usage

Call indexer with two command line arguments, the first being the crawler directory you wish to index, and the second being the name of the file to save the index to. To run, call
`./indexer arg1 arg2`.  

Indextest runs with two arguments. The first is a file with a saved index, and the second is a new file to write to. 
To run, call
`./indextest`.
